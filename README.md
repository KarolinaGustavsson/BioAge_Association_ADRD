# BioAge_Association_ADRD
This is the code belonging to my master thesis project 'Biological Age and Individual Risk of 
Developing Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias'.

The dataset is a subset of AMORIS with creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting iron, calcium, uric acid, fasting total iron binding capacity, iron saturation, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, potassium, fructose amine, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, blood urea nitrogen, and phosphate.

Inspecting_data.nm.html: not needed for the association, getting to know the dataset.

Calculating_BA.nb.html: Calculating biological age in three ways (KDM, Phenoage, HD) with the help of the package bioage (https://github.com/dayoonkwon/BioAge/tree/master). 

Association.nb.html: looking at the association between biological age and ADRD, as well as ADRD subtypes such as alzheimers and vascular dementia.
